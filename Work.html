            <p style="font-size:120%;">For the production of mulberry silk, the sericulture process follows three primary steps.</p>
            <li style="font-size:120%;">Moriculture – the cultivation of mulberry leaves.</li>
            <li style="font-size:120%;">Silkworm rearing – promoting the growth of the silkworm.</li>
            <li style="font-size:120%;">Silk reeling – the extraction of silk filaments from the silkworm cocoons.</li>
            <p style="font-size:120%;">Finally, the silk filaments are woven together to form a thread. These threads are often plied together to form a yarn.</p>
            <h2 style="color:rgb(54, 9, 152);">Moriculture:
</h1><p style="font-size:120%;">Moriculture refers to the cultivation of mulberry plants, whose leaves are used as silkworm feed. These plants can be grown via three different methods:</p>
<li style="font-size:120%;">Cultivation from seeds.</li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">Root-grafting.</li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">Stem-grafting.</li>

<h2 style="color:rgb(54, 9, 152);">Silkworm Rearing:
</h1><li style="font-size:120%;">In sericulture, the silkworm rearing process begins with the laying of eggs by the female silk moth. Typically, 300-500 eggs are obtained from one female silk moth. These eggs (laid on a paper/cardboard sheet) are then disinfected with the help of a 2% formalin solution.</li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">The silkworm larvae initially have a good appetite. As they grow, their appetite slowly diminishes until their active stage. At this stage, the silkworm eats enthusiastically until its final feeding stage.</li>

</p>
<h2 style="color:rgb(54, 9, 152);">Silk Reeling:
</h1><li style="font-size:120%;">Inside the cocoons, the larvae undergo metamorphosis and turn into pupae. The harvesting of silk from these cocoons is the final stage of sericulture. First, the pupae inside the cocoon are killed by boiling the cocoon and exposing it to steam and dry heat. This process is called stifling.</li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">Now, the silk filaments are removed from the dead cocoon via a process called reeling.</li>
